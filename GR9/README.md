# Gutter_Rat 9mm Variant

This is the original modification. This mod is designed around 9mm belts with toothed GT2 pulleys and new steppers for X/Y, plus a new control board, however is designed to be the least destructive of the modifications and utilise as much of the E6 parts as possible. You will need to cut the X 2020 extrusion, but it will retain the stock mounting points in case you wish to roll back.

Currently it can be built to reuse the stock belts, stock pulleys and mounting gear, stock controller and stock motors. 

Of course, you can upgrade all these parts to better quality components, as the mod can be reconfigured easily. Please note the dimensions on the stock pulleys and spacers may vary from 3rd party options and require some further modification.
